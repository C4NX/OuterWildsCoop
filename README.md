The goal of this project is to create a mod that will allow you to play the game easily with your friends and to discover it together.

For now this project is in progress, so it does not work yet.

## Getting Started

How to install Outer Wilds Coop in 3 step ?

- To install Outer Wilds Coop you have to install [Melon Loader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=requirements) first in your Outer Wilds installation, you just have to follow the steps of [the automated installer](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/releases/latest/download/MelonLoader.Installer.exe) of melon loader.

- After you need the .dll mod, and yes otherwise it will be difficult to make it work üòÅ, you can get it [here](https://github.com/C4NX/OuterWildsCoop/releases/latest/download/WildsCoop.dll).
